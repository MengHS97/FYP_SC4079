# Final Year Project: Comparative Analysis of ResNet18 and VGG16 on Various Datasets
Welcome to our project repository where we perform a comparative analysis of two popular deep learning models, ResNet18 and VGG16, using a variety of datasets. Our aim is to understand the performance characteristics of these models under different data conditions and gain insights that can guide future research and applications. 

## Overview
In this project, we delve into the intricate details of how ResNet18 and VGG16 models perform when trained and tested on four different datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FashionMNIST, and MNIST. These datasets represent a wide range of complexities and characteristics, and by exploring these, we hope to understand how different model architectures respond to these variations.
