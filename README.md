# Final Year Project: Cryptography Techniques to Defend Neural Network from Adversarial Attacks
Welcome to our project archive where we conduct a comprehensive comparison of two renowned deep learning frameworks, ResNet18 and VGG16, utilizing diverse datasets. Our objective is to comprehend the performance attributes of these frameworks under varying data scenarios and gather knowledge that could steer upcoming research and implementations.

## Overview
In this project, we delve into the intricate details of how ResNet18 and VGG16 models perform when trained and tested on four different datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, FashionMNIST, and MNIST. These datasets represent a wide range of complexities and characteristics, and by exploring these, we hope to understand how different model architectures respond to these variations.
